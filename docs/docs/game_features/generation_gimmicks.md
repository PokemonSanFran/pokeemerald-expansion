# Generational Gimmicks

## Restrictions

Over the course of a battle, the player can only execute _one_ of each Generational Gimmick. Furtherfore, a player's Pokémon can only execute one Generational Gimmick per battle.

## Example
Leon has commanded his Charizard to Dynamax during his battle against Blue. Leon cannot Dynamax any more Pokémon during this battle. Charizard cannot use a Z-Move, Mega Evolve, or any other such Gimmick during this battle.
