# Manual
[`pokeemerald-expansion`](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) is a fork of pret's decompilation project, [`pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald). This fork has several goals:

- Allow fangame developers that are using `pokeemerald` as a base to quickly and easily use key features from [main series](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Core_series) Pokémon games.
- Reduce the barrier of entry for fangame developers to get into decomplilation development.
- Provide fangame developers a collection of optional quality of life (QoL) improvements to improve developer and player experience.

`pokeemerald-expansion` is a collection of different features, fixes and modifications from [hundreds of different developers](credits.md), artists and players to help make a comprensive experience.

This manual's goal is to detail all of the features available to developers that have chosen to use `pokeemerald-expansion`, and provide guidance on how to use them in their projects.
