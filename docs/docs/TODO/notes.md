Hi Lucas!

1. Please clone this repo: https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/features.md
1. Navigate to `docs/` and run `/script/serve.sh` and then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) (thanks.)
1. I'm working through [fileChecklist.md](fileChecklist.md) right now.

The following features are in [Egg's original post](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=417820), but I don't think need top level pages in documentation.

* Triple Pokemon Types in-battle
* Dual-type moves
* Experience on catch
* Faster battle intro

The following features are in the [Github README](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion#readme), but I don't think need top level pages in documentation.

* Physical/Special/Status Category Split.
* New evolution methods.
* Updates National Dex incorporating all the new species.

I believe the goal of this documentation is 

1. What are the features of expansion?
2. How does a developer interface with the features of expansion?

I believe that tutorials like "how to add a new type" should be **referenced** in our documentation but are not in scope for inclusion in the documentation.

📖: I think the page should be moved to the manual and deleted.

📚: I think the page should stay as is.

❌: I think the page should be deleted.

Most pages have a "improvements" section at the top, which details all the things that should be added before the documentation can be considered complete.
