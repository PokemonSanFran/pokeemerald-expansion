## Generational Gimmicks
Each generation of Pokémon after Gen 5 has a major mechanic unique to that generation that influences battle.

Over the course of a battle, the player can only execute _one_ of each Generational Gimmick. Furtherfore, a player's Pokémon can only execute one Generational Gimmick per battle.

### Example
Leon has commanded his Charizard to Dynamax during his battle against Blue. Leon cannot Dynamax any more Pokémon during this battle. Charizard cannot use a Z-Move, Mega Evolve, or any other such Gimmick during this battle.
