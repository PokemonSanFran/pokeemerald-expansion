Using `pokeemerald-expansion` gives the developer the ability to use Pokemon, Items, Moves, Abilities and Types from main-series games after `pokeemerald`.

**Usage**: After installation, `pokeemerald-expansion` makes no changes to the core gameplay of `pokeemerald`. Develoeprs wanting to use these new features can do so with ease.

### Abilities and Types

Abilities and Types that were introduced after `pokeemerald` are automatically assigned to their respective Pokemon unless explcitly turned off by the developer.
