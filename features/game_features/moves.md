Using `pokeemerald-expansion` gives the developer the ability to use Pokemon, Items, Moves, Abilities and Types from main-series games after `pokeemerald`.

**Usage**: After installation, `pokeemerald-expansion` makes no changes to the core gameplay of `pokeemerald`. Develoeprs wanting to use these new features can do so with ease.

### Moves
#### Learnsets

Pokemon that debuted after Generation 3 have their most recent learnsets, including new Moves. Pokemon that debuted in Generations 3 or older return their learnsets from `pokeemerald`. This can be easily changed with programs like [Porymap](), which allow developers to control which game's information is used to inform learnsets.
