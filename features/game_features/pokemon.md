Using `pokeemerald-expansion` gives the developer the ability to use Pokemon, Items, Moves, Abilities and Types from main-series games after `pokeemerald`.

**Usage**: After installation, `pokeemerald-expansion` makes no changes to the core gameplay of `pokeemerald`. Develoeprs wanting to use these new features can do so with ease.

### Pokemon
#### Wild Pokemon

Developers can edit `src/data/wild_encounters.json` or use [Porymap]() to edit the wild Pokemon that appear on each route. New Pokemon can be set the same way old Pokemon are.

**Usage**:
```diff
        {
          "map": "MAP_ROUTE101",
          "base_label": "gRoute101",
          "land_mons": {
            "encounter_rate": 20,
            "mons": [
              {
                "min_level": 2,
                "max_level": 2,
                - "species": "SPECIES_WURMPLE"
                + "species: "SPECIES_BURMY"
              },
```

#### Starter Pokemon

The Pokemon declared as starters can be changed by the developer by editing `src/starter_choose.c`.

**Usage**:
```diff
static const u16 sStarterMon[STARTER_MON_COUNT] =
{
    - SPECIES_TREECKO,
    - SPECIES_TORCHIC,
    - SPECIES_MUDKIP,
    + SPECIES_PIPLUP,
    + SPECIES_ROWLET,
    + SPECIES_LITTEN,
};
