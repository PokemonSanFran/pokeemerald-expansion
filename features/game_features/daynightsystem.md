Originally created by merrp, this system uses the Game Boy Advance's RTC to expand on the "time of day" mechanic found in modern Pokemon games.

### Time
The cycle of one day matches that of the real world. The times of day are defined as follows:

- Morning: 6am - 12pm
- Mid-Day: 12:01pm - 8pm
- Night: 8:01pm - 5:59pm
